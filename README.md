## Demo of MediaStream API

This is a small demo to captura media using the getUserMedia API of WebRTC. It is in the *getUserMedia* folder.

## Demo of RTCPeerConnection locally

This is a small demo to undestand how RTCPeerConnection works. For that, it is running locally without the use of a signalling server (Every signallying information and ICE candidates are exchange directly in the code) to fully understand the RTCPeerConnection API.
